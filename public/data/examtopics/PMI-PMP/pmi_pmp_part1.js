            "content": "Correct answer is C. <br><br>B cannot be correct. Why? Because, how can stakeholders help with prioritization when they don't even understand the existence of the project (the vision). And plus, backlog prioritization is for the Product Owner, the project team and maybe a few SMEs (only if required). Including all of the stakeholders in backlog refinement is just going to be too many conflicts and extra noise, resulting in decisions not being made on time, specially when stakeholders do not understand the project/product vision.<br><br>Creating a definition of the MVP will help the stakeholders see, feel, understand and provide feedback at a very early stage rather than waiting for the end of the project to understand or realize the benefits, and by then maybe it is already too late. You would lose support of many of your key stakeholders.",

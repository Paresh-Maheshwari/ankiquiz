Validate the requirement change with the product owner and development team before redefining the scope.<br><br>If a project manager discovers a customer requirement change during a daily meeting in a frequently changing project, it is important to carefully assess the impact of the change before proceeding. The project manager should validate the requirement change with the product owner and development team to ensure that it is feasible and aligns with the project goals. Based on this assessment, the project manager can then work with the team to redefine the scope as needed and determine any additional effort that may be required. It may also be necessary to escalate the change to management for approval, but this should not be the first step taken. Telling the customer that the requirement change will be put into the next project phase or giving the change to the scrum master to investigate are not appropriate actions, as they do not address the need to validate the change and assess its impact on the project.",

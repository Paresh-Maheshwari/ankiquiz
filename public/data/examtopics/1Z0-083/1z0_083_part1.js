BACKUP VALIDATE of a backup performs the same disk reads as a real backup but performs no I/O to an output device.<br>D -> If the time for the BACKUP VALIDATE to tape is about the same as the time for a real backup to tape, then reading from disk is the likely bottleneck.<br>C -> If the time for the BACKUP VALIDATE to tape is significantly less than the time for a real backup to tape, then writing to the output device is the likely bottleneck.<br>B -> Some operating systems support native asynchronous I/O. If and only if your disk does not support asynchronous I/O, then set DBWR_IO_SLAVES.

To do so (on most platforms), you set only a target memory size initialization parameter (MEMORY_TARGET) and optionally a maximum memory size initialization parameter (MEMORY_MAX_TARGET).<br><br>https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/admin/managing-memory.html#GUID-0E201F66-D280-472A-AD80-20AB8F7E9C01 :<br>You can omit the statements that set the SGA_TARGET and PGA_AGGREGATE_TARGET parameter values to zero and leave either or both of the values as positive numbers. In this case, the values act as minimum values for the sizes of the SGA or instance PGA. <br>In addition, you can use the PGA_AGGREGATE_LIMIT initialization parameter to set an instance-wide hard limit for PGA memory.
